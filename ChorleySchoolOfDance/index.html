        <div class="principle-text">
          <h3>Claire Chorley began Dancing at the Neale Academy of Dance in Coventry at the age of five. She soon discovered a love for dancing and took her exams, competed in Festivals and performed in shows until the age of twenty three, when she then decided to open her own school.</h3>
          <h3>As well as being a member of The Neale Academy of Dance, at the age of seventeen she became a member of The Coventry Youth Dance. It is here she discovered her love for Contemporary Dance which we can all see in her Choreography today.</h3>
          <h3>Claire’s pupils all compete in Festivals three times a year and regularly win numerous medals and trophies. She never picks her ‘best’ pupils to take part in competitions and shows. She firmly believes all children, regardless of their talent, should be given the opportunity to perform in front of an audience.</h3>
          <h3>Claire works hard to instil confidence into all her pupils and believes this is the most important part of her quest. She is very proud of her pupils and never tires of teaching them. Year after year she strives to improve their Dance technique and is very satisfied with their progress.</h3>
